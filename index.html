<h1>Skanda: <span>The Attacker</span></h1>
<h5>Rayudu is the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh who arranges his daughter's <br>marriage. During the marriage, the son of
Chief Minister of Telangana Ranjith Reddy arrives <br> at the marriage venue as a guest and elopes with her to everybody's
shock. This angers both the Chief Ministers and they turn  <br>into bitter foes from friends.

Meanwhile, Bhaskar Raju is a college student who kidnaps <br> Rayudu's daughter and Ranjith Reddy's daughter, Sreeleela
Reddy, who also happens to be his classmate. <br> It is revealed that kidnappings are connected to the CEO of the Crown Group <br>
Company Rudrakanti Ramakrishna Raju, who is awaiting his death penalty <br> and was imprisoned falsely by both Ranjith Reddy
and Rayudu for refusing to legitimize  <br>their illegal money. It is also revealed that Ramakrishna Raju is actually the <br>
best friend of Bhaskar's father Manikanta Raju. Bhaskar wants <br> to prove Ramakrishna Raju's innocence as he was forced to <br>
take the blame in order to protect his daughter Rudraganti Parineeta from harm as <br>she was held captive by Ranjith and
Rayudu's men. <br>

With no choice, Ranjith and Rayudu bails out Ramakrishna Raju from prison. <br> Following this, the duo attack Bhaskar and
his family, but they are <br> saved by Bhaskar's doppelgänger Skanda. Eventually, Ranjith and Rayudu confess their crimes to <br>
the media. When Ramakrishna Raju inquires about Skanda, <br>it is revealed that Skanda is a notorious assassin from Morocco <br>
who is responsible for the death of Morocco-based powerful crime boss <br> Daniel. After learning about his history, Rayudu <br>
and Ranjith Reddy becomes frightened of him as he walks away smiling,  <br>indicating that his story will unfold in the <br>
sequel titled Skanda 2.[10]</h5>
